                     <p><b>How to help the birds in your Garden</b></p>
                  <p>
                    With the growth of the economy an the concreate jungles of the City it leads to a lot of our animal friends being forced out of their home. 
                    this makes it a lot harder for them to repreoduce as their ecosystems are often destroyed with the development of new urban zones. In efforts to aim our feathered friends 
                    Wilson Zoo have found terrific ways in which we can help our Animal friends.

                  <p><b>The Bird Feeder</b></p>
                  <p>
                    Birds can eat up to 10,000 calories a day, they spend most of the day looking for food for their young and consuming food. Bird Feeders help birds
                    by cutting down on the time they spend on gatheting food. Click the link below to learn how to build a bird feeder with 
                    household items.

                  <p><b>The Bird Bath</b></p>
                  <p>
                    As birds have waterproof feathers they don't actually use Birth Bath's to bathe. They use it to release dirt that gets stuck in their feathers.
                    This allows for a much more fluid movement when flying around. They also use the bird bath as a drinking water.
